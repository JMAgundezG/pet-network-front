# Petma project

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the development server

You can start the server using this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Watch out if you have the environment variable to connect with the API.

in a `.env` file, add the following (change the url to your API url)):

```bash
SERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) (or in port 3001 if you started before the project) with your browser to see the result.
